<!--
 "a" will be 1, because the value of a is decremented by 1 using the -- operator before it is used in the expression.
 "b" will be 1, because the value of b is decremented by 1 using the -- operator before it is used in the expression, but then it is incremented by 1 using the ++ operator.
 result will be 3, because the expression will be evaluated as follows:
"--a" is 1, because the value of a is decremented by 1 before it is used in the expression.
"--a" - "--b" is 1, because the value of b is decremented by 1 before it is used in the expression.
"--a" - "--b" + "++b" is 2, because the value of b is incremented by 1 before it is used in the expression.
"--a" - "--b" + "++b" + "b--"" is 3, because the value of b is used in the expression before it is decremented by 1.
So, the final values of the variables will be a = 1, b = 1, and result = 3. -->
